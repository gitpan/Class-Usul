Name
    Class::Usul - A base class providing config, locking, logging, and l10n

Version
    Describes Class::Usul version v0.23.$Rev: 1 $

Synopsis
       use Moo;

       extends q(Class::Usul);

       $self = Class::Usul->new( $attr );

Description
    These modules provide a set of base classes for Perl packages and
    applications that provide configuration file loading
    Class::Usul::Config, locking to single thread processes IPC::SRLock,
    logging Class::Usul::Log and localization Class::Usul::L10N

    The class Class::Usul::Programs is a base class for command line
    interfaces

    Interprocess communication is handled by Class::Usul::IPC

    Class::Usul::File makes the functionality of File::DataClass available

    The Module::Build subclass Class::Usul::Build adds methods for the
    management and deployment of applications

Configuration and Environment
    Defines the following attributes;

    config
       The "config" attribute should be a hash ref that may define key/value
       pairs that provide filesystem paths for the temporary directory etc.

    config_class
       Defaults to Class::Usul::Config and is of type "LoadableClass". An
       instance of this class is loaded and instantiated using the hash ref
       in the "config" attribute. It provides accessor methods with symbol
       inflation and smart defaults. Add configuration attributes by
       subclassing the default

    debug
       Defaults to false

    encoding
       Decode input and encode output. Defaults to "UTF-8"

    Defines an instance of IPC::SRLock

    Defines the application context log. Defaults to a Log::Handler object

Subroutines/Methods
  new_from_class
       $usul_object = $self->new_from_class( $application_class ):

    Returns a new instance of self starting only with an application class
    name. The application class in expected to provide "config" and "debug"
    class methods. The hash ref "$application_class->config" will be passed
    as the "config" attribute to the constructor for this class

  dumper
       $self->dumper( $some_var );

    Use Data::Printer to dump arguments for development purposes

  _build__lock
    Defines the lock object. This instantiates on first use

    An IPC::SRLock object which is used to single thread the application
    where required. This is a singleton object. Provides defaults for and
    returns a new IPC::SRLock object. The keys of the
    "$self->config->lock_attributes" hash are:

    debug
       Debug status. Defaults to "$self->debug"

    log
       Logging object. Defaults to "$self->log"

    tempdir
       Directory used to store the lock file and lock table if the "fcntl"
       backend is used. Defaults to "$self->config->tempdir"

Diagnostics
    Setting the *debug* attribute to true causes messages to be logged at
    the debug level
